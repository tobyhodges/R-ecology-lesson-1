We will use the code block and output below to demonstrate one of the new features
provided by The Carpentries Workbench: automated feedback about changes to the
rendered lesson content that would be made by a pull request.


```r
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="fig/06-pyramid-example-rendered-pyramid-1.png" alt="pie chart illusion of a pyramid"  />
<p class="caption">Sun arise each and every morning</p>
</div>
